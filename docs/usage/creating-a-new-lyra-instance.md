# Create a new Lyra instance

Creating a new instance is very simple.

## Create

We `create` a new instance (from now on database) with an **indexing `schema`**.

The schema represents **the structure** of the document to be inserted.

A database can be as simple as:

```js title="lyra.js"
import { create } from '@lyrasearch/lyra';

const db = create({
  schema: {
    word: 'string',
  }
});
```

or more variegated

```js title="lyra.js"
import { create } from '@lyrasearch/lyra';

const movieDB = create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    director: 'string',
    plot: 'string',
    year: 'number',
    isFavorite: 'boolean',
  }
});
```

### Nested Properties

:::tip

Lyra now supports nested properties! Try them out.

:::

```js title="nested-properties.js"
const movieDB = create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    plot: 'string',
    cast: { 
      director: 'string',
      leading: 'string'
    },
    year: 'number',
    isFavorite: 'boolean',
  }
});
```

## Input Analyzer

By default, Lyra analyzes the input and performs a `stemming` operation, which
allows the engine to perform more optimized queries, as well as saving indexing
space.

<details><summary>What is stemming?</summary>
In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">Wikipedia</a>
</details>

By default, Lyra uses **the English language analyzer**, but we can override
this behaviour by setting the property `defaultLanguage` at database
initialization.

```js title="lyra.js"
const db = new Lyra({
  schema: {
    word: 'string'
  },
  defaultLanguage: 'italian',
});
```

Currently the available languages are:

- dutch
- english (default)
- french
- italian
- norwegian
- portuguese
- russian
- spanish
- swedish
