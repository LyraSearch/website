# Delete Data

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
backgroundColor: color, borderRadius: '20px', color: '#fff', padding: '10px',
cursor: 'pointer', }} onClick={() => {
alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`); }}> {children}
</span> );

Deletion is one of the easiest things to do in Lyra.<br/> Let's say we have the
following database with the following inserted documents:

```js title="lyra.js"
import { create, insert, search, remove } from '@lyrasearch/lyra'; 

const movieDB = create({
  schema: {
    title: 'string',
    director: 'string',
    plot: 'string',
    year: 'number',
    isFavorite: 'boolean'
  }
});

const { id: thePrestige } = insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'The prestige',
  director: 'Christopher Nolan',
  plot: 'Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.',
  year: 2006,
  isFavorite: true
});

const { id: bigFish } = insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'Big Fish',
  director: 'Tim Burton',
  plot: 'Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.',
  year: 2004,
  isFavorite: true
});

const { id: harryPotter } = insert(movieDB, {
  title: 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone',
  director: 'Chris Columbus',
  plot: 'Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.',
  year: 2001,
  isFavorite: false
});
```

> Notice that we are also importing the **`remove`** method

## Delete

To delete a single document from the database we use the
<a href="/usage/insert-data#doc-ids" >Document ID</a> exposed by the **insert**
method.

```js title="lyra.js"
remove(movieDB, harryPotter);
```

As simple as that.

### Parameters

The `remove` method accepts two mandatory parameters.

1. the `database` in which the deletion should occur.
2. the `id` of the document to be deleted.
