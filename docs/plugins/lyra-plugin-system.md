# Lyra plugin system

Since the beginning of the project, Lyra has been developed thinking of a simple
way to add new features via a plugin system, leaving the core as small as
possible.

The Lyra core team is currently working on hooks, which will allow the community
to interact with the Lyra processes easily.

That said, the Lyra core team is working on some official plugins to support
specific features that might not be useful for the general public. That way, you
will be able to bring in only the features you really need.

All the official plugins source code is hosted under the
[LyraSearch](https://github.com/lyrasearch) organization.

## Official plugin list

As for now, the official plugins are:

- `plugin-data-persistence`
  ([repo](https://github.com/lyrasearch/plugin-data-persistence),
  [docs](/plugins/plugin-data-persistence))
- `plugin-astro` ([repo](https://github.com/lyrasearcg/plugin-astro),
  [docs](/plugins/plugin-astro))
